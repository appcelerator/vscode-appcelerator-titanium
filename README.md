### Build tools

Use the command palette and commands listed above to build and run your Appcelerator project. Follow instructions to select platform, target and (if appropriate) code signing. The last build destination is saved for quick recall.

By default the integrated terminal is used to execute the build command.

### Autocompletion

Autocompletion support is provided to help speed up development by providing quick references to Titanium APIs and Alloy markup as well as references to modules, widgets and assets within your project.

#### Generation

On initial launch, autocomplete suggestions are generated for the active Titanium SDK in your project and the Alloy vesion in your active CLI.

Autocomplete suggestions can be regenerated by running the `Generate autocomplete suggestions` command from the command palette.

#### Titanium and Alloy

Titanium APIs and Alloy markup suggestions are provided in Titanium JavaScript and Alloy XML and TSS files. This includes classes, properties, methods and events.
