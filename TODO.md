Things to do before PR'ing debugger

* Cleanup code/commits

* DebugConfigurationProvider?
	* Rather than the static initialConfig stuff - Dont think need to do?

* Run tests fully against ks-v2 and lambus
* Validate pre-8.1.0 SDK usage, and pre 7.1.0 CLI usage
* 8.1.0/7.1.0 RC?

Future plans

* Attach support
	* Finish iOS support by fleshing out UX
	* Figure out Android support properly
* Context menu item on device in Device Explorer to start debug session
* Context menu item on device in Device Explorer to generate a debug config (not sure if possible?)
