Interested in contributing? You can follow the below to ensure your contribution goes smoothly and is a great experience.

## File an issue

For any contribution we first ask that you [file an issue](https://github.com/appcelerator/vscode-appcelerator-titanium/issues/new/choose), this helps us keep track of any necessary changes, as well as discuss and agree on a plan of action to ensure landing your changes goes as smoothly as possible.

## Getting set up for development

1. Just to be safe, remove or move your existing installation at `~/.vscode/extensions/???`
2. Fork into your GitHub account and clone your fork.
3. `cd` into and run `npm install` in your project.
4. Open the project in VS Code `code .`
5. Open the debug tab and click "Start Debugging" (the green play icon). The debugger will start a the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.

You're now up and running with the extension running in another workspace. When you make changes to the TypeScript the watch task will automatically compile then for you, and you just need to reload the extension yourself using the green restart button on the main window, or by click `Cmd+R` (Windows: `Ctrl+R`) in the extension window.
